CISC320-010/011 (Group 5) 
Project 1-COWS

For this project, you will need to write a program that solves the problem above and create a readme.txt 
that explains your solution at a high level. Inside your readme.txt file, 
make sure you clearly explain the algorithmic runtime of your program in terms of Big O. 
For full credit, you must be able to justify your program's complexity as average case O(c*log(c)+r).
